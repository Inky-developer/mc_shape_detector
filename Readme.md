# MC Shape Detector
This datapack is a proof-of-concept shape detector for minecraft. It is able to recognize basic shapes, such as points, lines, rectangles and circles. 
Right now this pack lacks basic functionality, like multiplayer compatibility. Also, shapes can only be drawn while the player is facing the north or south direction right now.

# Installation
Drag the datapack into the datapacks folder of your world and run the `/reload` command. You will see a message with information how to start drawing shapes.
