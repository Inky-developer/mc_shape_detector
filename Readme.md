# MC Shape Detector
This datapack is a proof-of-concept shape detector for minecraft. It is able to recognize basic shapes, such as points, lines, rectangles and circles. 
Right now this pack lacks basic functionality, like multiplayer compatibility.

# Installation
Drag the datapack into the datapacks folder of your world and run the `/reload` command. You will see a message with information how to start drawing shapes.
